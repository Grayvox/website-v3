In traditional computer science fashion, we're starting this blog with the _only_ possible choice: Hello, world.

It doesn't provide much, those words, outside signifying this is the "beginning" or the "start" of something. Is it even that though? Something? I'm not even sure of that yet. Hopefully though, in the future, I'll be able to answer with a resounding "yes".

So, what is this? Unless you weren't paying attention to the _very obvious giveaways_, it's a blog. My blog, specifically. As of now you won't be getting a name outside Gray, taken from my _very obvious username_. I prefer that name though, because of the general approach it takes. They say you should always view the world in shades of gray, so why not view me like that too? I have many sides to myself, some more interesting than others, but all important nonetheless.

If you truly need an explanation on who I am, you can visit the About page for that. But here I want to establish what this blog is going to focus on: Nothing.

Nothing, as in nothing specific. It will be my thoughts on any number of things - but I can guarantee they'll always have something to do with the internet. I'm fascinated by it, if you weren't able to tell - the idea of sharing information, that can be accessed through whatever web browser and search engine you choose. Admittedly though, most of you are using [Chrome](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) and [Google](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share), respectively, for that (No judgement though, as Chrome is especially useful from a dev standpoint for [good reason](https://www.quora.com/Do-most-software-developers-prefer-using-Google-Chrome-or-Mozilla-Firefox-for-web-development-and-why)).

This doesn't matter all that much in a lot of ways, but it does bring to light the unfortunate reality of big corporations "owning" the passage of the internet. Still, whatever you're using to read this web page, I can't complain. After all, I don't know why you'd want to read from me in the first place.

Speaking of, thank you - for taking the time to read this. Really. As short as it may be, the fact anyone would want to read what I have to say is very warming to that internal organ we call the heart. And hey, if you found this interesting enough, consider subscribing to get updates on when I post again. It's free and won't cost you a thing. Plus, I don't share that data with anyone else - really, I mean it. I hate data collection as much as you do.

That's all for now, folks. Thanks for reading, and until next time...
~Gray
