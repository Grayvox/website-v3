		<p>
			I'm Gray, short for Grayvox
			<span class="text-cat-subtext0">(/grƒÅ-v≈èks/)</span>. That's an

			I'm a writer at heart - of code, stories, games, novels, ideas... anything, 
			really. I'm currently working on some personal projects along with doing front 
			end work for <Link to="https://stable.dev">stable.dev</Link>, a hosting platform 
			for Discord bots that is as scalable as possible. If you're curious about doing
			work with me or have an employment opportunity you'd want me for, consider

				title="Writing"
				subtext=`"There's always another secret." ‚ÄïBrandon Sanderson, Mistborn: The Final Empire`
			>
				I write. A lot. In many ways it's at the root of all of my main passions 
				and endeavours. Keeping people up to date on my writing projects is hard
				because I often bounce between many at once. I also might be fixating on
				one that I won't be in a week. Tis the life of a neurodivergent writer...
				Anyways, in terms of my main writing projects, I run 
				<Link to="/writings/blog">my own blog</Link> right here on this website,
				which mostly discusses... anything and everything involving my current
				projects and learning. I plan on doing more short story work, and have
				a secret novel project in the works that will hopefully come to fruition
				enough that I can talk about it publically... but we'll see.

			<Card
				title="Programming"
				subtext=`"Code Is Poetry." ‚ÄïThe WordPress Foundation`
			>
				I started coding in Java, for Minecraft mods and plugins. Don't feel bad 
				for me, I did it to myself. Nowadays, I'm a bit insane, so I have tried 
				(and am still trying) experimenting with many different programming 
				languages for pure curiosity's sake. Currently, I'm finding TypeScript 
				to be my go to, however I also am dipping into Rust and Python, with a 
				bit of Go and C# planned for the future. Almost all of my projects are 
				open source on
				<Link to="https://github.com/Grayvox" line={true}>GitHub</Link>.
				My current focuses are a motivational and project app called
				<Link to="https://docs.grayvox.com/journalore/readme" line={true}>Journalore</Link>, 
				and a website template for web fictions called 
				<Link to="https://docs.grayvox.com/supernovel/readme" line={true}>Supernovel</Link>. 
				I dip into many different forms of programming from game dev, to system 
				level, to automation, to web servers... yeah. Expect a lot of random 
				projects.

			<Card
				title="Obsidian"
				subtext=`"...the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them." ‚ÄïSteph Ango`
			>
				Obsidian is my favorite software (that I've found). Put simply, it's a 
				Markdown file editor on steroids - featuring plugins, multiple styles of 
				file management, graph views, "Bases" for database tables and more. I'm 
				not hugely into the whole "second brain" methodology that many use with 
				it, but as a writer and intense planner, Obsidian is my driver for any 
				project I come up with. From novels, to job applications, to game design
				concepts, to TTRPG characters... I use it for everything basically. But
				above all, writing. I even wrote 
				<Link to="https://docs.grayvox.com/obsidian-plugins/readme" line={true}>some Obsidian plugins</Link>
				of my own too.
			</Card>
			<Card title="Video and Streams" subtext=`"Oxygen capitalism is a beautiful thing." ‚ÄïDougDoug`>
				When time allows, to showcase my projects and do talks on my current
				thoughts and random things I'm learning, I stream on 
				<Link to="https://twitch.tv/grayvoxdev">Twitch</Link>. Streaming happens 
				more often, since I often am not a consistent video editor, but can be 
				sporadic. I always give updates on my socials if I'm planning on going 
				live though, and if you still miss them, I post the VODs on 
				<Link to="https://youtube.com/@GrayvoxLive">my live channel</Link>.
				I also occasionally post edited videos on 
				<Link to="https://youtube.com/@Grayvox">my main channel</Link> and 
				something called 
				<Link to="https://youtube.com/@CavernOfThought">Cavern Of Thought</Link>.
				My main channel is for project videos, previews and occasional fiction 
				work. Meanwhile, Cavern Of Thought is a channel for short, simple videos
				about random topics involving writing, creating or coding new projects 
				and what I find is best to make them happen.
			</Card>
			<Card title="Game Dev" subtext=`"Was this a good decision? I believe so." ‚ÄïMike Klubnika`>
				I loved video games already - and then I found out making them is not that 
				difficult. This, coupled with the newly added Software and Game Development 
				category on Twitch, I finally decided a few years ago to make my game dev
				journey happen. Thus far, I've competed in 
				<Link to="https://grayvox.itch.io/noirdo">Pirate Jam 15</Link> and 
				<Link to="https://grayvox.itch.io/they-are-unworthy">16</Link>, with plans
				to compete in more jams and also make my own games seperately. The genres
				that I like to explore tend to be retro 2D, PS1 style 3D, visual novels, 
				horror and point and click. Creators like

				are my personal inspirations.
